# KnickpointFinder 
***A software tool that improves neotectonic analysis***

***`v1.1`***

> Software for extensive and dense knickpoint (stream slope anomaly) mapping in a fully-automatic manner. It performs morphometric analysis of drainage networks based on the methods of Hack (1973) and Etchebehere (2004) and is applicable to studies of geomorphology and neotectonics. The input is a digital elevation model (DEM), used to identify topographic breakpoints (knickpoints) along drainage profiles. This tool is coded in Python (v2.7) for use in ArcMap (v10.x).

## Setup
To run the tool, the user must first extract all the contents of the compressed folder and then open ESRI's ArcMap (v10.x). Then, one must find and open the KnickpointFinder.tbx toolbox in ArcCatalog and then open the KnickpointFinder script tool.


## Inputs
* **Digital elevation model (DEM)**: a raster DEM projected in a UTM coordinate system (eg. 30m SRTM DEM).
* **Watershed-scale**: the scale in which the watershed will be analyzed (eg. 1:100,000).
* **Î”h threshold**: the minimum height difference used to measure stream segments (eg. 10m).

**Figure**: Overview of the main steps in the KnickpointFinder algorithm: (A) input digital elevation model (DEM) raster; (B) watershed generated by a series of ArcGIS spatial analyst tools; (C) cleaned and fixed drainage lines with segments merged from source to mouth; (D) a slope/length formula is applied on the drainage profile - illustrated as a graph of height (h) versus length (l) - to identify anomalies; and (E) output knickpoints over a 3D drainage network.
